  <p id="answer-one">Bat: Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight. They have wings formed from a membrane of skin stretched 
    between elongated finger bones. With over 1,400 species, bats are incredibly diverse and can be found all over the world, except 
    in extreme deserts and polar regions.</p>

  <div class="body">
    <h2 onclick="showTwo()" ondblclick="hideTwo()">Which planet in our solar system spins on its side, making its poles alternately point towards and away from the Sun throughout
       its orbit?</h2>

    <i onclick="hideTwo()" id="hideMeTwo" class="fa-solid fa-circle-minus"></i>
  </div>

  <p id="answer-two">Uranus: Unlike most of the planets in our solar system, which spin on an axis roughly perpendicular to their 
    orbits, Uranus is tilted on its side, rotating nearly perpendicular to its orbit around the Sun. This unique tilt causes its poles 
    to experience extreme variations in sunlight and darkness over its 84-year orbit.</p>

  </div>
  
  <p id="answer-three">Strawberry: Contrary to popular belief, strawberries are not true berries. They belong to the rose family and 
    are classified as aggregate fruits. The edible part of a strawberry is a swollen receptacle that holds the flower's ovaries. The 
    seeds, which are the actual fruits, are embedded outside the strawberry's surface.</p>

  <p id="answer-four">Nile River: The Nile River is widely considered to be the longest river in the world, stretching approximately 
    6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles) in length. It flows through northeastern Africa, primarily through Egypt and Sudan, before emptying 
    into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile has played a crucial role in the development of ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptian 
    civilization, due to its fertile valley and the resources it provides.</p>

    <h2 class="quest">What phenomenon causes the Eiffel Tower to increase in height during the summer months?</h2>
    <p class="answ">The Eiffel Tower: The Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, actually grows in height during the summer due to thermal 
      expansion. When the temperature rises, the iron structure expands, causing the tower to grow by up to 15 centimeters (about 6 inches).
       Conversely, it contracts in colder temperatures.</p>

    <h2 class="quest">Where do pineapples grow, and how do they form into the fruit we eat?</h2>
    <p class="answ">Pineapples: Pineapples do not grow on trees; instead, they grow on a plant close to the ground. The fruit of the pineapple plant 
      forms from a cluster of flowers that fuse together to create a single fruit. It typically takes around 18 to 20 months for a
       pineapple to reach full maturity and be ready for harvesting.</p>

    <h2 class="quest">Which animal has the longest gestation period of any mammal?</h2>
    <p class="answ">The elephant. African elephants have a gestation period of about 22 months, while Asian elephants typically carry their 
      young for around 18 to 22 months.</p>
